                <h2>What's the project all about?</h2>
                <p>Salvus was a student-runned business that my team of 30 and I created under the program Junior Achievement. We were competing with multiple companies students created all across Ontario, however, we wanted our company to make a big impact in our society. We made this business in the prime of covid, which made us come up with the idea of dropshipping mask cases since that would be more sanitary and help with the environment and people’s health. We had multiple departments, each with their members and tasks they were provided.  On top of that, we wanted to make our company unique. Since our motto was helping the community, we decided that we would also raise awareness and advocate for indigenous communities using our platform. We made an indigenous campaign series and discussed the health inequalities with an indigenous member through a podcast. The project was sponsored by RBC which helped manage our funds and keep track of how our progress was going.</p>

                <h2>What tools did I use to make it?</h2>
                <p>In particular, I was a part of the Marketing department with the position of Marketing and Media Specialist. This meant I was responsible for making posts about the company/product and attracting customers. I used Canva in order to make the posts and company logo, and used Instagram to advertise. I also would put out daily stories and questionnaires to keep the customers engaged. Our team used Slack to communicate with each other and keep each department posted on what we are working on. </p>

                <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
                <p>This was my first time using softwares like Slack and Canva, so learning them became an asset to me. I was able to improve my design skills as well through the process of making many posts, and to understand what would attract a customer’s attention. This program also helped me feel what it was like to be a part of a real business, and how different departments come together to make the company. It felt very cool to be able to engage with others and through our weekly meetings, my communication and ability to work with others improved.</p>

                <h2>What was my contribution?</h2>
                <p>I contributed to many of the posts made on Instagram as well as the captions and stories. I also had to research about indigenous communities, specifically their health inequalities, lack of basic resources, information and housing crisis, and food insecurity. I also had to research about ways to help and how we as a community can make a positive impact for them. Besides researching about indigenous peoples, I needed to also go into why customers should buy mask cases and how they are useful. This included posts talking about how Covid-19 affected the world, how many germs could be on every mask, and how to clean the mask case for optimum hygiene.</p>

                <h2>What are its implications?</h2>
                <p>We were able to raise $200+ and give the proceeds to an organisation that helps with indigenous health inequalities by advocating to the government and taking matters into their own hands and using their money to assist in the crisis they’re facing. More than 100+ people bought the mask cases which would help with their help and staying sanitary during the covid times. Our instagram received 150+ followers, which meant that those people were both educated on indigenous issues and the informative posts we made about covid. I believe our company did have an impact on the First Nations communities, no matter the size.</p>
