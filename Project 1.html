                <h2>What's the project all about?</h2>
                <p>The Trash Sorting Robot was my final project for my MTE 100 (Introduction to Mechatronics)
                    course
                    in
                    the University of Waterloo. The assignment was essentially to create a robot of our choice
                    with
                    a
                    couple of requirements such as using multiple sensors and having at least 6 functions.
                    However,
                    we
                    were allowed to use any materials we wanted to create the robot as long as it was safe.
                    After a
                    week
                    of planning, my team of 4 decided to create a robot that will pick up a piece of trash and
                    sort
                    it
                    into its respective area, which were colour coded. We used T - shaped blocks to represent
                    our
                    trash,
                    green for compost, brown for garbage, blue for recycling, as well as red for the starting
                    zone
                    and
                    black for the pick-up zone. </p>

                <h2>What tools did I use to make it?</h2>
                <p>We created Trashy using an EV3 kit we were given, along with aluminium extrusions, wheels,
                    extra
                    sensors, strings, and a lot of duct tape to secure everything together. In terms of coding,
                    we
                    used RobotC, and each person had different functions assigned to them.</p>

                <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
                <p>I learnt how the manufacturing process and coding came together to create a robot that can be moved
                    without the need of a joystick or human interference. My coding skills had greatly improved as I
                    spent a lot of time debugging and changing my code to make it more efficient. I also had to adapt to
                    problems that arose, such as when the colour sensors did not pick up on certain colours. This meant
                    we had to change both the physical design and code to counter the problem and make it work. We made
                    the colour sensors closer to the ground, and made sure that the code could only pick up one colour
                    and not switch.</p>

                <h2>What was my contribution?</h2>
                <p>I helped in the building of the robot, specifically making the chassis. I used a reference online and
                    changed it to suit the materials we were given. It did prove to be a challenge at first since none
                    of the parts would align or stay properly, but with a bit of experimentation and trying different
                    combinations of designs, we got it to work. As for the coding side, I coded our follow line, colour
                    path, and finish function. Essentially, the follow line function would see the colours on either
                    side of the robot, and if one of them detected a colour it would move in the opposite way to correct
                    its path. For the colour path function, it would detect the colour of the block and then follow a
                    line until one of the colour sensors near the ground detected that specific colour, and if it did it
                    would turn and stop once both colour sensors detect the ground. The finish function took Trashy to
                    the start zone and made it “dance” (rotate a lot) and play a sound.</p>

                <h2>What are its implications?</h2>
                <p>If the robot were to be on a larger scale and can sort multiple variations and sizes of objects, then
                    it can be a useful application in the real world. For example, there are many types of garbage or
                    chemicals that can be dangerous if humans were exposed to it, in which case this robot would come in
                    handy. A robot would also be able to sort trash for longer periods of time than humans and more
                    efficiently. There could also be multiple robots to detect specific types of trash (ie. non-metal vs
                    metal using reflectivity) using different types of sensors.</p>
