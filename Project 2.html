                <h2>What's the project all about?</h2>
                <p>
                    The project was to design a robotic arm that would be able to pick up different sized bones and place them into a compartment/box placed at different heights on the wall. We were given only 2 days to put this together, essentially only a few hours, and so we had to manage our time wisely and plan out what we were going to do. We experimented with different designs and ended up choosing one where there were 3 motors, two at the base and one at the claw.

                <h2>What tools did I use to make it?</h2>
                <p>We were given a limited amount of tools to use, with 3 motors maximum and a select number of aluminium extrusions of different lengths. We also had the option to use wheels but we decided it was not necessary, we just needed to be careful with the placement of the robotic arm on the ground so that it could reach all the places it needed to. </p>

                <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
                <p>I was able to learn how difficult it can be to design a robotic arm from scratch. I also learnt that the process of truly understanding the problem at hand and coming up with a design that made sense was critical to producing a successful result. From seeing other studentâ€™s designs, I was able to understand that sometimes having a simpler design is better and more efficient than a more complicated one. For instance, the teams that used wheels had a harder time navigating their robot and picking up the bones. </p>

                <h2>What was my contribution?</h2>
                <p>I contributed to both the design and building process, as well as keeping record of the changes we made and challenges we faced which would be written in our final report.</p>

                <h2>What are its implications?</h2>
                <p>This robotic arm can be used for many applications in the real world. It could be used for trash sorting, as well as be used as a prosthetic arm if it were to be designed with hands instead of claws. Robotic arms are also used in many manufacturing companies, and so it is interesting to see how much thought process goes into designing them.</p>
